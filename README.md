🚀 Project Overview

Nmap Web Interface (Cloud Scanner) is a web-based cybersecurity application that allows users to perform authorized Nmap network scans through a simple and interactive browser interface.

The project eliminates the complexity of command-line scanning by providing a modern UI to analyze network targets, visualize scan results, and improve security awareness. It is ideal for students, ethical hackers, and system administrators.

✨ Features

🌐 Web-Based Scanning Interface
Run Nmap scans directly from a browser without terminal usage.

🔐 Ethical & Authorized Scans Only
Designed for controlled and responsible network testing.

📊 Detailed Scan Results
Displays open ports, services, protocols, and service versions.

📈 Interactive Visualization
Results are shown using clean tables and charts.

⚡ Multiple Scan Options
Supports:

TCP Scan

UDP Scan

Service Version Detection

OS Detection (if enabled)

🎨 Modern Responsive UI
Cybersecurity-themed design with dark/light mode support.

☁️ Cloud Deployment Ready
Can be hosted on cloud platforms like Vercel or AWS.

🧩 API Integration Support
Enables automation and integration with other security tools.

🧑‍🎓 Beginner Friendly
Perfect for learning Nmap concepts visually.

🛠️ How It Works

User enters a target IP or domain.

The system runs an authorized Nmap scan.

Scan results are processed on the backend.

Output is displayed in a user-friendly format on the dashboard.

🎯 Example Use Cases

Network security assessment

Cybersecurity learning projects

Ethical hacking labs

Server exposure analysis

Academic demonstrations

🌐 Open in Browser

Access the web interface at:

🔗 http://localhost:5173/

📊 How It Works

The user enters a target IP address or domain name through the web interface.

The application validates the input and initiates an authorized Nmap scan based on the selected scan options.

Nmap performs network scanning to identify:

Open ports

Running services

Service versions

Network protocols

The backend processes the scan output and sends structured results to the frontend.

Scan results are displayed in a clear, visual, and easy-to-understand format for analysis.

🧠 Example Use Cases

Performing authorized network reconnaissance

Learning Nmap scanning techniques through a visual interface

Analyzing server and network exposure

Cybersecurity academic projects and labs

Ethical hacking practice in controlled environments
